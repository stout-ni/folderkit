# Generating Your First Icon

This guide will walk you through the fundamental steps of using FolderKit to generate your first macOS-style folder icon. We will start with a basic example and then explore how to combine various options to achieve custom results.

You will need an image file to serve as the inner icon. For this guide, we will assume you have an image named `apple.png` in your project directory. You can use the [example image](https://github.com/stout-ni/folderkit/blob/main/packages/folderkit/examples/apple.png) from the repository for this.

## Basic Icon Generation

The most direct way to create an icon is by using the `generate` function. This function takes your source image and produces a PNG image buffer of the final icon with default settings.

The following script demonstrates how to:

1.  Pass the image to the `generate` function.
2.  Save the resulting icon buffer to a new `.png` file.

```javascript filename="index.js"
import { promises as fs } from "node:fs";
import { generate } from "folderkit";

// 1. Generate the icon using default options
const outputBuffer = await generate("apple.png");
// 2. Save the generated icon
await fs.writeFile("apple-folder-icon.png", outputBuffer);
```

After running this script, you will get a new file named `apple-folder-icon.png`. This icon uses the default theme (`BigSurLight`) and resolution (`256x256`).

## Changing Theme and Resolution

The most basic customization is to alter the icon's visual style and size. You can combine the `theme` and `resolution` options to match your specific design requirements.

For example, to create a high-resolution icon with a dark, modern look, you can use the `BigSurDark` theme with the `Retina512` resolution.

```javascript
import { generate, FolderTheme, Resolution } from "folderkit";

const customIcon = await generate("apple.png", {
  theme: FolderTheme.BigSurDark, // Use the Big Sur dark theme
  resolution: Resolution.Retina512, // Use a 512x512 retina resolution
});
```

If you prefer a more classic look, you can switch to the `Tahoe` theme.

```javascript
const tahoeIcon = await generate("apple.png", {
  theme: FolderTheme.Tahoe,
  resolution: Resolution.NonRetina128,
});
```

## Fine-Tuning the Fit with `trim`

The `trim` option controls how your source image is placed inside the folder template. By default, `trim` is set to `true`, which automatically removes any transparent space around your image, making it fit snugly within the folder's content area.

If your source image already has intentional padding that you wish to preserve, you can set `trim` to `false`.

```javascript
const paddedIcon = await generate("apple.png", {
  trim: false, // Disables auto-trimming to preserve original padding
});
```

This gives you more control over the final composition, especially when working with pre-designed assets.

## Applying Color Overlays with `filter`

The `filter.tintColor` option allows you to apply a color overlay to the final icon, which is perfect for branding or creating monochrome effects.

Let's generate a gray-toned icon by applying a black tint. This is useful for creating disabled or inactive state icons.

```javascript
const tintedIcon = await generate("apple.png", {
  filter: {
    tintColor: "#808080", // Apply a gray tint
  },
});
```

This powerful option can be combined with any theme, allowing you to create a consistent set of icons that match your application's color palette.
