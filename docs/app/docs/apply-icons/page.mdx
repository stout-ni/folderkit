# How to Apply Your Custom Icons on macOS

After generating an icon with FolderKit, the final step is to apply it to a folder on your Mac. The process is straightforward but differs slightly depending on whether you are using a single `.png` file or a complete `.icns` file.

## Using Copy and Paste

<Steps>
### Open and Copy the Image

Locate your generated `.png` icon file and open it in the **Preview** app.

Once the image is open, select the entire image by pressing `Cmd + A`. Then, copy it to the clipboard by pressing `Cmd + C`.

### Select the Target Folder Icon

In Finder, click to select the folder whose icon you want to change.

With the folder selected, open the "Get Info" window by pressing `Cmd + I` or by right-clicking and choosing "Get Info".

In the top-left corner of the "Get Info" window, click on the small folder icon. A blue highlight will appear around it, indicating it's selected.

### Paste the New Icon

Press `Cmd + V` to paste the image from your clipboard. The folder's icon will update immediately.

</Steps>

You can access [Apple Support: Change icons for files or folders on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchlp2313/mac) for more specific instructions.

> [!WARNING]
>
> When you paste image data from the clipboard, macOS creates the necessary icon resources and stores them in a hidden `Icon?` file inside the folder.
>
> Therefore, if you are working within a Git repository, **remember to add `Icon?` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it**.

## Revert to Default Icon

If you want to remove a custom icon and restore the default blue folder icon, the process is simple.

<Steps>
### Select the Folder Icon
In Finder, select the folder with the custom icon.

Open the "Get Info" window (`Cmd + I`).

Click the custom icon in the top-left corner of the "Get Info" window to select it.

### Cut the Icon

In the menu bar, choose **Edit > Cut** or press `Cmd + X`. The custom icon will be removed, and the original system default will reappear immediately.

</Steps>

For users comfortable with handling hidden files, you can directly delete the `Icon?` file.

<Steps>
### Navigate to the Folder
Open the folder containing the custom icon in Finder.

### Show Hidden Files

Press `Cmd + Shift + .` (period) to toggle the visibility of hidden files.

### Delete the File

You will see a semi-transparent file named `Icon?`. Delete this file.

The folder's icon will revert to the default immediately. You can press `Cmd + Shift + .` again to hide the hidden files.

</Steps>
