## FAQ

### Does FolderKit have a CLI?

No, FolderKit does not include a CLI.

The primary goal of FolderKit is to provide a modern, programmatic API for developers who need to generate macOS icons within their TypeScript/JavaScript projects.

If you require a command-line tool for generating folder icons, we recommend using the original project that inspired FolderKit: **[lgarron/folderify](https://github.com/lgarron/folderify)**. It is an excellent tool specifically designed for CLI usage.
