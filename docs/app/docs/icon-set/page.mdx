# Creating a Complete macOS Icon Set

While single icons are useful, macOS applications require a complete icon set to ensure they display correctly across different contexts and display resolutions. This guide explains how to use FolderKit to generate a standard `.iconset` directory, the first step in creating a native `.icns` file.

## The `.icns` Format and Resolutions

> The Apple Icon Image format (`.icns`) is a container file format that bundles multiple image resources into a single file. This allows macOS to select the most appropriate image for different display contexts, such as the Finder, the Dock, or application launchers, ensuring clarity at any size.

To support this, icons must be provided in a range of standard sizes, including both standard (1x) and high-resolution Retina (2x) variants. The required sizes typically range from 16x16 up to 512x512 pixels (or 1024x1024 for App Store assets). For more details, please refer to [Apple Icon Image format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format).

FolderKit automates the tedious part of this process: generating all the necessary individual PNG files from your source image, correctly sized and named according to Apple's specifications.

## Using `generateIconSet`

The `generateIconSet` function is designed specifically for this purpose. It creates a directory, populates it with all the required icon files, and prepares it for the final conversion step.

The script below demonstrates how to call `generateIconSet` to create a `.iconset` directory.

```javascript filename="create-iconset.js"
import { generateIconSet, FolderTheme } from "folderkit";

await generateIconSet("apple.png", "GenericFolderIcon.iconset", {
  theme: FolderTheme.Tahoe,
});
```

When you run this script, FolderKit will create a new directory named `GenericFolderIcon.iconset` and fill it with all required PNG variants.

## Converting to `.icns`

Creating the `.iconset` directory is the first part of the process. The final step is to convert this directory into a single, deployable `.icns` file using Apple's native **`iconutil`** command-line tool.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `iconutil` is a specialized tool available on macOS, used for handling `.icns` files and icon sets. It is a part of the macOS operating system and therefore **cannot be directly installed or run on other operating systems**.

As instructed by the console output from FolderKit, run the following command in your terminal to complete the conversion:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
iconutil --convert icns MyCoolApp.iconset
```

This command will create a file named `MyCoolApp.icns` in the same parent directory. This `.icns` file is the final artifact that you can assign to a folder or include in a macOS application bundle.

### What is the difference between using a `.png` file and an `.icns` file to set a folder icon?

The primary difference lies in quality and format.

- **`.icns`** is the native macOS icon format. It acts as a **container** that holds multiple versions of the icon at various pre-rendered resolutions (e.g., 16x16, 512x512, and their Retina @2x variants). When you use an `.icns` file, macOS can select the perfect, pixel-perfect image for any display context, ensuring maximum clarity and sharpness. This is the professional standard for application and system icons.

- **`.png`** is a standard single-image format. When you use a `.png` to set a folder icon, macOS takes that single, high-resolution image and **automatically generates** the smaller sizes it needs. While convenient, this automated downscaling can sometimes result in a loss of detail or sharpness, especially at very small sizes.

**In summary**: Use `.icns` for the best possible quality in all situations. Use `.png` for quick, convenient customizations where minor quality differences are acceptable.
